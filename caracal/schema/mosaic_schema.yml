mapping:
  mosaic:
    desc: Mosaic the 2D-images (or cubes) made with the selfcal/crosscal (or line) worker. If not available on disc, the primary beam is built by the mosaic worker, assuming a Gaussian shape with FWHM = 1.02 lambda/D.
    type: map
    mapping:
      enable:
        desc: Execute the mosaic worker.
        type: bool
        required: true
        example: 'False'
      mosaic_type:
        desc: Type of mosaic to be made, either continuum (2D) or spectral (3D).

        required: false
        example: "directory/first_image.fits, directory/second_image.fits"
      label_in:
        desc: For autoselection of images, this needs to match the label/label_cal setting used for the selfcal/crosscal worker (when mosaicking continuum images) or the label setting used for the line worker (when mosaicking cubes).
        type: str
        required: false
        example: 'corr'
      line_name:
        desc: Spectral mode only -- If autoselection is used to find the final cubes, this needs to match the line_name parameter used for the line worker.
        type: str
        required: false
        example: 'HI'
      use_mfs:
        desc: Continuum mode only -- If the images to be mosaicked were created using MFS, in the selfcal or crosscal worker, then this needs to be indicated via this parameter.
        type: bool
        required: false
        example: 'False'
      name:
        desc: The prefix to be used for output files. Default is the pipeline prefix, as set for the general worker.

      domontage:
        desc: Re-grid the input images, and associated beams.

            required: false
            example: 'True'
      cutoff:
         desc: The cutoff in the primary beam. It should be a number between 0 and 1.
         type: float
         required: false
         example: '0.1'
      dish_diameter:
        desc: If no continuum pb.fits are already in place, user needs to specify the dish diameter (in units of m) so that rudimentary primary beams can be created.
        type: float
        required: false
        example: '13.5'
      ref_frequency:
        desc: If no continuum pb.fits are already in place, user needs to specify the reference frequency (in units of Hz) so that rudimentary primary beams can be created.
