type: map
mapping:
  mosaic:
    desc: Mosaic the 2D-images (or cubes) made with the selfcal/crosscal (or line) worker. If not available on disc, the primary beam is built by the mosaic worker, assuming a Gaussian shape with FWHM = 1.02 lambda/D.
    type: map
    mapping:
      enable:
        desc: Execute the mosaic worker.
        type: bool
        required: true
        example: 'False'
      mosaic_type:
        desc: Type of mosaic to be made, either continuum (2D) or spectral (3D).
        type: str
        enum: ['continuum', 'spectral']
        required: true
        example: 'continuum'
      target_images:
        desc: List of .FITS images/cubes to be mosaicked. Their file names must end with "image.fits" and must include the path relative to the current working directory. These images/cubes MUST be located within (sub-directories of) the current working directory.
        seq:
          - type: str
        required: false
        example: ''
      label_in:
        desc: For autoselection of images, this needs to match the label/label_cal setting used for the selfcal/crosscal worker (when mosaicking continuum images) or the label setting used for the line worker (when mosaicking cubes).
        type: str
        required: false
        example: 'corr'
      line_name:
        desc: Spectral mode only -- If autoselection is used to find the final cubes, this needs to match the line_name parameter used for the line worker.
        type: str
        required: false
        example: 'HI'
      use_mfs:
        desc: Continuum mode only -- If the images to be mosaicked were created using MFS, in the selfcal or crosscal worker, then this needs to be indicated via this parameter.
        type: bool
        required: false
        example: 'False'
      name:
        desc: The prefix to be used for output files. Default is the pipeline prefix, as set for the general worker.
        type: str
        required: false
        example: ''
      domontage:
        desc: Re-grid the input images, and associated beams.
        type: map
        mapping:
          enable:
            desc: Enable the 'domontage' (i.e. re-gridding) segment.
            type: bool
            required: false
            example: 'True'
      cutoff:
        desc: The cutoff in the primary beam. It should be a number between 0 and 1.
        type: float
        required: false
        example: '0.1'
      pb_type:
        desc: If no continuum pb.fits are already in place, user needs to choose whether a rudimentary primary beam is created ('gaussian') or one that follows the model of Mauch et al. (2020), relevant for MeerKAT data ('mauchian').   
        type: str
        enum: ['gaussian', 'mauchian']
        required: false
        example: 'gaussian' 
      dish_diameter:
        desc: If 'pb_type' has been set to 'gaussian', user needs to specify the dish diameter (in units of m).
        type: float
        required: false
        example: '13.5'
      ref_frequency:
        desc: If no continuum pb.fits are already in place, user needs to specify the reference frequency (in units of Hz) so that primary beams can be created.
        type: float
        required: false
        example: '1383685546.875'
      round_cdelt3:
        desc: If mosaic_type is "spectral", round CDELT3 in the header of the input cubes to the number of decimal digits given by this parameter (0 means do not round). This is useful when the CDELT3 values of the input cubes are not identical (which would make the mosaicking algorithm crash) but the differences are small and can be ignored. Note that the CDELT3 values of the input cubes are overwritten with the common, rounded value (if the rounding is sufficient to find a common value).
        type: int
        required: false
        example: '0'
      report:
        type: bool
        required: false
        desc: (Re)generate a full HTML report at the end of this worker.
        example: 'False'
      cabs:
        desc: 'Specifies non-default image versions and/or tags for Stimela cabs. Running with scissors: use with extreme caution.'
        required: false
        seq:
          - type: map
