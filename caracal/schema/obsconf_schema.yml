                example: 'owlcat'
                required: false
      target:
        desc: The field name(s) of the target field(s), separated by commas if there are multiple target fields. Or set this parameter to 'all' to select all of the target fields.
        seq:
          - type: str
        required: false
        example: 'all'
      gcal:
        desc: The field name(s) of the gain (amplitude/phase) calibrator field(s). Or set 'all' to select all of the gcal fields, 'longest' to select the gcal field observed for the longest time, or 'nearest' to select the gcal field closest to the target. Note that if multiple targets and gcals are present, then 'all' (for both the 'target' and 'gcal' parameters) means that each target will be paired with the closest gcal.
        seq:
          - type: str
        required: false
        example: 'all'
      bpcal:
        desc: The field name(s) of the bandpass calibrator field(s). Or set 'all' to select all of the bpcal fields, 'longest' to select the bpcal field observed for the longest time, or 'nearest' to select the bpcal field closest to the target.
        seq:
          - type: str
        required: false
        example: 'longest'
      fcal:
        desc: The field name(s) of the fluxscale calibrator field(s). Or set 'all' to select all of the fcal fields, 'longest' to select the fcal field observed for the longest time, or 'nearest' to select the fcal field closest to the target.

        example: 'longest'
      xcal:
        desc: The field name(s) of the crosshand phase-angle calibrator field(s). Or set 'all' to select all of the xcal fields, 'longest' to select the xcal field observed for the longest time, or 'nearest' to select the xcal field closest to the target. This calibrator must be linearly polarized and have a non-zero parallactic angle coverage at the time of observation in order to solve for the X-Y offsets in digitizers and the absolute polarization angle of the system. Successful calibration derotates U from V.

        required: false
        example: 'longest'
      refant:

        type: str
        required: false
        example: 'auto'
      maxdist:
        desc: If 'refant' is set to 'auto' above, this sets the maximum distance the reference antenna should be from the array centre. Units are in 'm'.
