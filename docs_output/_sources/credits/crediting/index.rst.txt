Sharing
_______

We encourage users to send us a reference to their publication, to post pretty images and to share their data reduction strategies (a configuration file with an optional description) with other users. For that purpose we maintain the `CARACal publications, pretty images, and data reduction strategies (PPD) table <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/151wHTYM1KQoI3QRGNdUHAk0dteWpIZxFtHm5ZVO9bCQ/edit?usp=sharing>`_.
Please submit any of the following, along with an expressive permission to make it publicly available on the internet, using the links below:

* `A configuration (.yml) file of your CARACal data reduction <https://github.com/caracal-pipeline/caracal-docs/issues/8>`_
  
* `An explanation of your CARACal data reduction strategy pursued in the configuration file (e.g. the data reduction section of your paper) <https://github.com/caracal-pipeline/caracal-docs/issues/8>`_
  
* `A reference to your publication (partly) based on a CARACal data reduction <https://github.com/caracal-pipeline/caracal-docs/issues/9>`_

* `A (link to a) pretty astronomical image (partly) based on your CARACal data reduction <https://github.com/caracal-pipeline/caracal-docs/issues/6>`_
    
* `A (link to a) picture of you being happy about CARACal <https://github.com/caracal-pipeline/caracal-docs/issues/7>`_
    
* `Anything else that you want to share <https://github.com/caracal-pipeline/caracal-docs/issues/10>`_

We will then make your contributions available to the community on the www in the `PPD table <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/151wHTYM1KQoI3QRGNdUHAk0dteWpIZxFtHm5ZVO9bCQ/edit?usp=sharing>`_.
