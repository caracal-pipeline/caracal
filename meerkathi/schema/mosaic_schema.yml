            required: false
            example: 'True'
      cutoff:
         desc: The cutoff in the primary beam. It should be a number between 0 and 1.
         type: float
         required: false
         example: '0.1'
      use_MFS_images:
        desc: Indicate that the images to be mosaicked were created using MFS.

        required: false

        example: ''
      target_images:
        desc: List of images to be mosaicked, with suffix of image.fits being expected.

        seq:
          - type: str
        required: false
        example: "directory/first_image.fits, directory/second_image.fits"
      dish_diameter:
        desc: If no continuum pb.fits are already in place, user needs to specify the dish diameter(in units of m) so that rudimentary primary beams can be created.
        type: float
        required: false
        example: '13.5'
      ref_frequency:
        desc: If no continuum pb.fits are already in place, user needs to specify the reference frequency(in units of Hz) so that rudimentary primary beams can be created.

        required: false
        example: '1383685546.875'
      label:
        desc: For autoselection of images, this needs to match the label setting used for the self_cal worker (when mosaicking continuum images) or the image_line worker (when mosaicking cubes).
        type: str
        required: false
        example: 'corr'
      line_name:
        desc: Spectral mode only -- If autoselection is used to find the final cubes, this needs to match the line_name parameter used for the image_line_worker.
